## Infrastructure Finance, Markets, and Regulation

##Hello, I am Alex Lee. I am a teacher&social worker turned economist. I currently work in retail electricity market policy and regulation. 

I am interested in 1) wholesale electricity economics, 2) banking crises & credit risk, 3) macroeconomic modeling, and 4) industrial policy & political economy. 

I am fluent in Spanish, have working Vietnamese proficiency, some Mandarin and Cantonese, and familiarity with various writing systems. My favorite hobbies include Japanese calligraphy seals, music theory, and foreign languages. I am interested in pursuing a Doctorate in Economics in the short term, and bronze age archaeology & linguistic evolution in the long term. 

Thank you for visiting my profile!
